Topic: Why India's AQI is high?

Summary:
India's Air Quality Index (AQI) frequently registers as unhealthy or worse, indicating a severe environmental challenge.
This crisis is primarily driven by rapid industrialization, high population density, and insufficient infrastructure.
Additionally, lax enforcement of environmental regulations exacerbates the problem.
The pervasive air pollution significantly impacts public health, leading to increased respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and contributing to premature mortality.
It also negatively affects economic productivity and the overall quality of life across the nation.

Conclusion:
The persistently high AQI in India is a critical issue stemming from a complex interplay of developmental and regulatory factors.
Addressing this requires comprehensive strategies focusing on sustainable industrial practices, urban planning, and stringent environmental policy implementation to safeguard public health and the environment.

Interesting Fact:
In 2019, approximately 1.67 million deaths in India were attributed to air pollution, accounting for 17.8% of the country's total deaths.
